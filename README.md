	- The purpose of this analysis is well defined (4 pt)

OVERVIEW

The Purpose

The purpose of this analysis is to use the credit card dataset from a peer-to-peer lending services company called LendingClub. The dataset from this company will allow analysts to use algorithms to oversample the data, use a combinational approach, and compare 2 machine learning models. Using the final results of the dataset, analysts will evaluate the performance of the models and recommend whether or not the models should be used to predict credit risk for the LendingClub. 



2. Results: Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy 
scores and the precision and recall scores of all six machine learning 
models. Use screenshots of your outputs to support your results.
